# quote-app

Mobile app that retrieves quotes from an external API. Has a login/logout functionality, quote category sidebar and a list of the saved quotes that the user can also delete. 

App uses firebase for user authentication and firestore database for storing the quotes. Currently only has one account for testing purposes.

Test username: test1@foo.com
Test password: test1234
Also visible on login screen so should not have need to type but just in case.
